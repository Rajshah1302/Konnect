# ETH Connect

**Inclusive Metaverse Hackathon Platform on Celo**

ETH Connect is an **accessibility-first hackathon platform** built to empower specially-abled people and introverts by enabling **on-chain self-verification** and **seamless event participation**. The platform extends into a **2D metaverse space** where participants can interact, collaborate, and join hackathons without barriers.

Live on **Celo Mainnet** with deployed smart contracts, a fully functional frontend, and a backend server, ETH Connect proves that innovation should be driven by **ideas, not physical or social constraints**.
